# SwiftHelperKit

Collection of convenience classes and functions for Cocoa/Swift programming.

### Usage

I use it this way: I add this repository as git submodule to an existing project and drag the files I need to my target. Usually there is no need to use all the files in a new project, I only pick the ones that are relevant for the particular project.

### Idea

The idea is to have a collection of helpful classes and functions with full unit test code converage that can be safely used accoss different projects.
